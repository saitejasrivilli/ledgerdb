# Changelog

## v0.2 — Single-partition append-only log

**Adds:** Segment-based storage layer (`storage/`) — fixed-size segment
files with length-prefixed records and a fixed-width offset index, segment
rolling, retention-based compaction (delete whole old segments, never the
active one), crash recovery via index rebuild-by-scan on open.

**Design doc:** `docs/design_log_storage.md`

**Tests:** `tests/regression/v0_2_log_storage_test.go`
- `TestV02_SequentialWriteRead` — 100 sequential offsets round-trip
- `TestV02_SegmentRoll` — tiny max-segment-size forces rolls, reads still
  correct across segment boundaries
- `TestV02_CrashRecovery` — close/reopen rebuilds index, offsets continue
  correctly after recovery
- `TestV02_Compaction` — old segments deleted, retained data still readable,
  compacted-away offsets correctly error (not silently wrong)

**Breaking check:** all v0.1 Raft tests re-ran unmodified, still green —
`go test ./... -race -count=5` clean across both packages.

**Not yet implemented:** no Raft integration for this log yet (v0.4), no
partitioning (v0.3), no compression (v0.8).

## v0.1 — Raft consensus foundation

**Adds:** Leader election (randomized timeout, RequestVote RPC w/
up-to-date-log check) and log replication (AppendEntries RPC, log
matching + conflict backtracking, majority-commit rule restricted to
current-term entries). Single Raft group, in-process simulated network
(`raft/network.go`) standing in for labrpc — supports reliable/unreliable
modes and connect/disconnect for partition tests.

**Design doc:** `docs/design_raft.md`

**Tests:** `raft/raft_test.go`
- `TestInitialElection` — fresh cluster converges on one leader, term stable
- `TestReElection` — leader failure triggers new election; recovers after
  reconnection
- `TestBasicAgreement` — command commits on all 3 servers
- `TestFailAgree` — cluster keeps committing via quorum with one follower
  disconnected; disconnected follower catches up on reconnect
- `TestUnreliableAgree` — agreement still completes under simulated packet
  loss/delay

**Verified:** `go test ./raft/... -v` and `go test ./raft/... -race -count=10`
both green (see terminal output at tag time — 10 consecutive race-detector
runs, no flakes).

**Not yet implemented (explicit non-goals for this version):**
- Persistence across restart (state kept in-memory only)
- Log compaction / snapshotting (lands in v0.2)
- Cluster membership changes
- Multiple Raft groups (lands in v0.4)
